## xmas-icetube Firmware ##
###########################

My father gave me an Ice Tube Clock kit from Adafruit as a Christmas gift
last year.  As an excuse to learn AVR programming, I started playing with
the software.  Eventually, none of the original code remained and the project
became a feature-rich reimplementation of the original Adafruit firmware.

## FEATURES ##
##############

Many of the features in the xmas-icetube firmware were first implemented in
other firmware projects; see the CREDITS file for details.  This firmware
boasts the following improvements over the official Adafruit firmware.

  - animated display transitions
  - multiple time and date formats
  - optionally pulse display during alarm and snooze
  - three alarm times for selectable days of the week
  - functional alarm during power outage
  - adjustable alarm volume (from 0 to 10)
  - progressive alarm option (gradually increasing volume)
  - selectable alarm sound (high frequency beeps, low frequency beeps,
    high frequency three beep pulse, low frequency three beep pulse,
    Merry Christmas, Big Ben, Reveille, or For He's a Jolly Good Fellow)
  - adjustable snooze duration
  - DST support (USA, EU, or manual)
  - fully automatic correction for time drift
  - time-from-GPS support*
  - temperature compensated timekeeping*
  - no beeping or time loss after external power failure
  - 4-fold or 25-fold* increase in backup battery life
  - low battery warning before battery failure
  - per-digit brightness adjustment for uneven displays
  - automatic brightness control by ambient light*
  - optionally disable display during specified time periods
  - optionally disable display at night (when dark)*
  - IV-18 VFD tube driven to specifications*

*  These hacks require hardware modification and support must be enabled by
   uncommenting macros in config.h.  See the HACKS AND MODS section of
   this file as well as the comments in config.h for more information.


For Ice Tube Clock hackers, this firmware has

    (1) compatibility with the ATMEGA328P,
    (2) a pseudo object-oriented design,
    (3) good source code documentation, and
    (4) display/menus by finite state machine.

## INSTALLATION ##
##################

Installation requires GNU Make, avr-libc, avr-gcc, and avrdude; the
instructions below presume proficiency with these tools.

This firmware requires the ATMEGA328P:  not the ATMEGA168V included
with the Ice Tube Clock kit.  Due to the many features, this firmware
currently requires ~25 kb of flash, but the ATMEGA168V only has 16 kb.
Also, if your ATMEGA328P has an Arduino bootloader installed, it will
not work without reconfiguration.  See the TROUBLESHOOTING section for
reconfiguration instructions.

To program the chip, any avrdude-compatible ISP programmer should work,
but programming has been tested with the Adafruit USBtinyISP, the Atmel
AVR Dragon, and an Arduino programed with the ArduinoISP sketch.

Compilation and installation has been tested under

    (a) Ubuntu Linux 12.04 with the avr-gcc and avrdude packages,
    (b) Mac OS 10.6 with MacPorts' avr-gcc and avrdude packages, and
    (c) Windows 7 with WinAVR and Cygwin's perl and bash packages.

To compile and install this firmware, first configure compile-time
options by editing config.h; then, build and install the project using
the included Makefile:

(1) Edit the Configuration Variables

    First, review the macro definitions in config.h, changing macro
    definitions as needed to enable support for various hardware hacks.
    The default values in config.h are suitable for the Adafruit Ice Tube
    Clock v1.1 without any hardware mods or hacks.  For the xmas-icetube
    clock, it may be more convenient to copy the config.h file from the
    hardware directory and edit that as desired:

	% cp ../hardware/config.h config.h

    Next, review the Makefile to ensure that configuration variables
    are reasonable given your hardware.  In particular, AVRISP and
    AVRDUDEOPT seem most likely to require attention.

(2) Compile the Firmware

    Build icetube_fuse.hex, icetube_flash.hex, icetube_eeprom.hex, and
    icetube_lock.hex which contain the fuse bits, program memory (flash),
    EEPROM data, and lock bits:

	% make

(3) Connect the Programmer

    Before unplugging the clock, reduce the display brightness to the
    minimum.  Ensure the clock has an ATMEGA328P installed and not
    an ATMEGA168V.  Unplug and disassemble the clock.  Most users
    report that the clock cannot be programmed without removing the
    side PCB with VFD tube, so remove that.  Reconnect the power
    adaptor.  Connect the AVR programmer to the clock's ISP header,
    ensuring that pin one on the cable and the marked pin on the clock's
    ISP header match.

(4) Install the Firmware

    Install this firmware to an ATMEGA328P by setting the fuse bits,
    writing the flash program, writing the EEPROM data, and setting
    the lock bits:

        % make install-all

    Alternatively, this firmware may be installed in separate steps:

        % make install-fuse
        % make install-flash
        % make install-eeprom
        % make install-lock

:: Programming Fails with an Arduino Chip ::

The Arduino Uno chip is an ATMEGA328P, but will not work in an Ice
Tube Clock without reconfiguration.  Arduino chips have their fuse
settings configured to use an external 16 MHz oscillator for the
system clock.  The Ice Tube Clock does not provide a suitable external
oscillator, and without an external oscillator, an Arduino chip will
not function--not even to be reconfigured.

To provide an external oscillator for reconfiguration, insert the
Arduino chip into an Arduino board.  Next, connect a programmer to the
ISP on the Arduino board and reprogram the fuses with the xmas-icetube
Makefile:  "make install-fuse".  The ATMEGA328P's fuse settings are
now configured to use the 8 MHz internal oscillator and can be
installed and programmed as described in the INSTALLATION section.

This method is also described in the following thread:

:: Dim Digits ::

The per-digit brightness control in the xmas-icetube firmware provides
one way to increase the brightness of dim digits, but increasing
current across the VFD filament often produces better results.  The
most straightforward way to increase filament current is to replace
R3 with a jumper:

:: Nonfunctional Drift Correction ::

Initially the clock will not perform drift correction.  Use the clock
normally and the automatic drift correction will eventually enable
itself.  Accuracy will improve over time.

The clock estimates time drift when users change the time by more than
15 seconds.  The fastest way to enable drift correction is to (1) set
the correct time, (2) wait for the clock to drift by more than 15
seconds, and (3) set the correct time.

Occasionally setting an incorrect time will not have much affect on
drift correction, and changing time for different timezones or
daylight saving is similarly unproblematic.  The automatic drift
correction method is quite robust:

:: Unstable Crystal Oscillator ::

Oscillator caps C8 and C9 are a bit large.  Usually this only means
that the clock consistently runs slow, losing a few seconds each day.
When the time is periodically corrected, the automatic drift
correction detects that the clock is running slow and compensates
timekeeping accordingly.

Much less commonly, the quartz oscillator will not function--or much
worse--operate intermittently.  Faulty operation causes time loss
and/or clock resets.  After such a reset, the clock will periodically
display "wdt rset" to warn of time loss.  This message indicates that
the watchdog timer ("wdt") has expired and the watchdog circuit has
reset ("rset") the clock.  The most straightforward solution to this
problem is to replace C8 and C9 with 10 pF caps:
