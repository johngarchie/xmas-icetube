My father gave me an Ice Tube Clock kit from Adafruit as a Christmas gift last
year.  As an excuse to learn AVR programming, I started playing with the
software.  Eventually, none of the original code remained and the project
became a feature-rich reimplementation of the original Adafruit firmware.

## FEATURES ##
##############

Many of the features in the xmas-icetube firmware were first implemented in
other firmware projects; see the CREDITS file for details.  This firmware
boasts the following improvements over the official Adafruit firmware.

  - animated display transitions
  - multiple time and date formats
  - optionally pulse display during alarm and snooze
  - three alarm times for selectable days of the week
  - adjustable alarm volume (from 0 to 10)
  - progressive alarm option (gradually increasing volume)
  - selectable alarm sound (high frequency beeps, low frequency beeps,
    high frequency three beep pulse, low frequency three beep pulse,
    Merry Christmas, Big Ben, Reveille, or For He's a Jolly Good Fellow)
  - adjustable snooze duration
  - DST support (USA, EU, or manual)
  - fully automatic correction for time drift
  - time-from-GPS support*
  - no beeping or time loss after external power failure
  - 2-fold or 25-fold* increase in backup battery life
  - functional alarm during power outage**
  - per-digit brightness adjustment for uneven displays
  - automatic brightness control by ambient light*
  - optionally disable display during specified time periods
  - optionally disable display at night (when dark)*

*  These hacks require hardware modification and support must be enabled by
   uncommenting macros in config.h.  See the HACKS AND MODS section of
   this file as well as the comments in config.h for more information.

** The snooze feature, musical alarm, and progressive alarm are automatically
   disabled during a power failure.  While on battery power, the buzzer alarm
   sounds at the menu-settable maximum volume and the alarm can only be enabled
   or disabled via the alarm on/off switch.  All other inputs are ignored until
   power is restored.


For Ice Tube Clock hackers, this firmware has

    (1) compatibility with the ATMEGA328P,
    (2) a pseudo object-oriented design,
    (3) reasonably good commenting, and
    (4) display/menus by finite state machine.

## INSTALLATION ##
##################

Installation requires GNU Make, avr-libc, avr-gcc, and avrdude; the
instructions below presume proficiency with these tools.

This firmware requires the ATMEGA328P:  not the ATMEGA168V included
with the Ice Tube Clock kit.  Due to all the features, this firmware
currently requires ~25 kb of flash, but the ATMEGA168V only has 16 kb.
Also, if your ATMEGA328P has an Arduino bootloader installed, it will
not work without reconfiguration.  See the TROUBLESHOOTING section for
reconfiguration instructions.

To program the chip, any avrdude-compatible ISP programmer should work,
but programming has been tested with the Adafruit USBtinyISP, the Atmel
AVR Dragon, and an Arduino programed with the AduinoISP sketch.

Compilation and installation has been tested under

    (a) Ubuntu Linux 12.04 with the avr-gcc and avrdude packages,
    (b) Mac OS 10.6 with MacPorts' avr-gcc and avrdude packages, and
    (c) Windows 7 with WinAVR and Cygwin's perl and bash packages.

To compile and install this firmware, first configure compile-time
options by editing config.h; then, build and install the project using
the included Makefile:

(1) Edit the Configuration Variables

    First, review the macro definitions in config.h, changing macro
    definitions as needed to enable support for various hardware hacks.

    Next, review the Makefile to ensure that configuration variables
    are reasonable given your hardware.  In particular, AVRISP and
    AVRDUDEOPT seem most likely to require attention.

(2) Compile the Firmware

    Build icetube_flash.hex and icetube_eeprom.hex, which contain
    the firmware and initial EEPROM contents:

	% make

(3) Connect the Programmer

    Before unplugging the clock, reduce the display brightness to the
    minimum.  Ensure the clock has an ATMEGA328P installed and not
    an ATMEGA168V.  Unplug and disassemble the clock.  Most users
    report that the clock cannot be programmed without removing the
    side PCB with VFD tube, so remove that.  Reconnect the power
    adaptor.  Connect the AVR programmer to the clock's ISP header,
    ensuring that pin one on the cable and the marked pin on the clock's
    ISP header match.

(4) Install the Firmware

    Write the new fuse bits, which *do* differ from those in the original
    Adafruit firmware and other alternative firmware projects:

	% make install-fuse

    Next, upload the compiled firmware and initial EEPROM contents:

	% make install

(5) Set lock bits

    Since this firmware does not need self-programming capabilities,
    lock bits should be set to prevent self-programming; this provides
    an added measure of security against program memory corruption:

        % make install-lock

## HACKS AND MODS ##
####################

Development of the various hacks and mods supported by this firmware
have been discussed extensively in the Adafruit discussion board.
Options requiring hardware changes can be enabled by uncommenting
macros in the config.h file.  Comments in the config.h describe each
optional feature in detail.

:: Programming Fails with an Arduino Chip ::

The Arduino Uno chip is an ATMEGA328P, but will not work in an Ice
Tube Clock without reconfiguration.  Arduino chips have their fuse
settings configured to use an external 16 MHz oscillator for the
system clock.  The Ice Tube Clock does not provide a suitable external
oscillator, and without an external oscillator, an Arduino chip will
not function--not even to be reconfigured.

To provide an external oscillator for reconfiguration, insert the
Arduino chip into an Arduino board.  Next, connect a programmer to the
ISP on the Arduino board and reprogram the fuses with the xmas-icetube
Makefile:  "make install-fuse".  The ATMEGA328P's fuse settings are
now configured to use the 8 MHz internal oscillator and can be
installed and programmed as described in the INSTALLATION section.

This method is also described in the following thread:

:: Dim Digits ::

The per-digit brightness control in the xmas-icetube firmware provides
one way to increase the brightness of dim digits, but increasing
current across the VFD filament often produces better results.  The
most straightforward way to increase filament current is to replace
R3 with a jumper:

:: Unstable Crystal Oscillator ::

Oscillator caps C8 and C9 are a bit large.  Usually this only means
that the clock consistently runs slow, losing a few seconds each day.
When the time is periodically corrected, the automatic drift
correction detects that the clock is running slow and compensates
timekeeping accordingly.

In some cases, the quartz oscillator will not function--or much
worse--operate intermittently.  Faulty operation causes time loss
and/or clock resets.  After such a reset, the clock will periodically
display "wdt rset" to warn of time loss.  This message indicates that
the watchdog timer ("wdt") has expired and the watchdog circuit has
reset ("rset") the clock.  The most straightforward solution to this
problem is to replace C8 and C9 with 10 pF caps:
